# How to download data from Facebook
- Log in to your account on [facebook](https://Facebook.com/)
- Navigate through Settings -> your Facebook Information -> Download your Information
- Media quality doesn't matter for this application
- This program works for both formats, but JSON is way faster and HTML still has some bugs and lacks some features
- After you make a request to create a file, it usually takes ~1-2 days until you can download it
- After downloading the files, unzip them somewhere - this will be your "Conversation directory"
# About
Inspired by r/dataisbeautiful, I decided to make my own data visualization tool to visualize Facebook Messages using the data you can download.

To make it, I used Python for all the data reading and calculations with Dash library for making the graphs and BeautifulSoup library for parsing HTML files. To create a simple UI, I made a C# program using WPF to display the inputs and the informations, and interact with the Python script that I converted to an exacutable using PyInstaller to work on machines without Python.

The user is presented with an interactive dashboard, which shows many interesing graphs and updates them in real-time after selecting a  timeframe on a main graph. The customization includes: changing colors for each person, enabling/disabling certain features and modifying graph parameters.

Tips, criticism or any feedback is most welcome.
